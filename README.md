# Lan Server Properties
For Minecraft 1.16 and above, Forge version >= 28

When this mod is installed, it will add a few new things to the "Open to LAN" Gui, which then allows the user to start the LAN game on a specific port, and also provides an option to disable the "online mode". Disabling the "online mode" allows unauthenticated players to join the game.

## For developers
To modify and debug the code, first import the repo as a gradle project in Eclipse IDE, then run the ForgeGradle task `genEclipseRuns`.
